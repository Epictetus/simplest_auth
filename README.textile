simplest_auth is a Rails plugin to be used where Restful Authentication is a bit overkill

h1. Usage:

* Install the simplest_auth plugin from github:

bq. script/plugin install http://github.com/vigetlabs/simplest_auth.git

* Install the bcrypt-ruby gem

bq. sudo gem install bcrypt-ruby

* Create your user model class and include SimplestAuth::Model; required fields are email and crypted_password (password/_confirmation are accessors)
* Add validations however you'd like for email and password
* Add a callback to hash the password into crypted_password, e.g.,

bq. before_create :hash_password

* Include SimplestAuth::Controller in your Application controller
* define a method user_class that simply returns the model class you defined, e.g.,

bq. def user_class
  User
end

h1. BCrypt:

We chose to use bcrypt to avoid having to worry about complex hashing algorithms and salting, etc.
