simplest_auth is a Rails plugin to be used where Restful Authentication is a bit overkill

Usage:
- Install the simplest_auth plugin from github:
script/plugin install http://github.com/vigetlabs/simplest_auth.git
- Install the bcrypt-ruby gem
sudo gem install bcrypt-ruby

- Create your user model class and include SimplestAuth::Model; required fields are email and crypted_password (password/_confirmation are accessors)
- Add validations however you'd like for email and password
- Add a callback to hash the password into crypted_password, e.g.,
before_create :hash_password

- Include SimplestAuth::Controller in your Application controller
- define a method user_class that simply returns the model class you defined, e.g.,
def user_class
  User
end

BCrypt:

We chose to use bcrypt to avoid having to worry about complex hashing algorithms and salting, etc.
